"""ASR engines: the one seam between audio and the feedback half.

Three implementations of one small interface:

* ``RealMuaalemEngine`` — the GPU path: silero VAD chunks upstream, then the Muaalem
  multi-level CTC model, decoded reference-free (see transcribe.py). Byte-identical
  to the pre-merge Al-Mahir pipeline.
* ``ZipformerAsrEngine`` — streaming phoneme-CTC (Muno459/zipformer_p-quran via
  sherpa-onnx), CPU-only. StreamSession's waqf/pause endpointing already hands every
  engine one finalized utterance-sized wave at a time, so this engine decodes each
  chunk independently (a fresh sherpa-onnx stream per call) rather than keeping
  cross-chunk streaming state — the underlying model is architecturally streaming,
  but nothing here needs it to be, given how it's invoked. No per-character
  confidence or sifat detection: see ZipformerAsrEngine's docstring.
* ``MockEngine`` — no model at all. It fabricates the transcript a *perfect* reciter
  would have produced from the session cursor, using the real phonetizer. This lets
  the whole backend + frontend loop run on a machine with no GPU, and lets frontend
  work proceed without the model. The only fiction is the confidences.

Engines are built once at startup (see main.py's build_engines) and selected
PER SESSION from the ``start`` message's ``engine`` field (api/ws.py) — falling back
to Settings.resolved_asr_engine's choice for an unknown/omitted name.
