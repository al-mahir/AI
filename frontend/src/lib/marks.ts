/**
 * Turning the backend's feedback into marks on the page.
 *
 * This is where the contract's three warnings are honoured, or quietly broken:
 *
 *   `almost`     is NOT a soft error. It means the model is not confident enough to
 *                accuse. It renders as a hint, never as a mistake, and never counts
 *                against the score. A learner falsely corrected on a verse they recited
 *                perfectly concludes the app cannot hear them, and does not come back.
 *   `trimmed`    means UNVERIFIED, not correct: the word sat on a chunk boundary and was
 *                never scored. It gets its own neutral mark — never a tick.
 *   `ambiguous` / `no_match` assert NOTHING. `words` is empty. Nothing is painted, and
 *                the candidates are never treated as an answer.
